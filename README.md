# AI for Fun

## Overview
Welcome to "AI for Fun", a public repository dedicated to exploring and demonstrating the capabilities of multi-modal AI models. This repository is designed as a resource for enthusiasts, researchers, and developers interested in the integration and application of different AI modalities such as text, image, speech, video, and more. Whether you're looking to learn, build, or simply explore, this repository offers a structured collection of model examples across various domains.

## Repository Structure
The repository is organized into several folders, each dedicated to a specific type of multi-modal model. Below is the structure and a brief description of what you will find in each folder:

- **Text-to-Image**: Models that generate images from textual descriptions.
- **Text-to-Speech**: Systems that convert text into audible speech.
- **Text-to-Video**: Tools that create video content based on textual inputs.
- **Audio-Visual Models**: Models that use both audio and visual data to perform tasks such as speech recognition.
- **Text and Image-to-3D Models**: Conversion tools that turn text and images into 3D models.
- **Video and Language Models**: Models that generate or analyze video content through text.
- **Cross-Modal Retrieval**: Tools for retrieving one type of media using another type (e.g., retrieving images using text descriptions).
- **Multi-Modal Sentiment Analysis**: Systems that analyze sentiments using combined inputs such as text, video, and audio.

Each folder contains a mix of examples, documentation, and benchmark results for the models it includes.

## How to Use This Repository
- **Explore**: Browse through the folders to discover different multi-modal models and their applications.
- **Learn**: Each model includes documentation and references to help you understand how it works and its use cases.
- **Experiment**: You can download and run the examples to see the models in action.
- **Contribute**: Contributions are welcome! Whether you're improving existing examples, adding new ones, or suggesting changes, please feel free to make a pull request.

## Benchmarks and Metrics
For those interested in the performance of these models, we reference benchmarks and evaluation metrics commonly accepted in the AI community. This will help you understand the effectiveness of each model and compare them objectively.

## Getting Started
To get started with the repository:
1. Navigate into the folder of interest.
2. Follow the individual READMEs and google colab in each folder for instructions on running the models.

## Contributing
We encourage contributions from the community.
